## Introduction


### What is Precision Medicine ?

> Medical approach that considers factors such as <span style="color:blue" > genomic makeup </span>, <span style="color:blue" > molecular profile </span> of the disease, <span style="color:blue" >lifestyle</span> and other <span style="color:blue" >individual factors</span>. Precision medicine helps guide treatment decision in cancer treatments and targeted therapies.


#### Advantages over Traditional Treatment
* <span style="color:blue" > Increase of effectiveness of the drug</span>
* <span style="color:blue" > Decrease of side effects </span>
* <span style="color:blue" > Customize disease-prevention strategies </span>
* <span style="color:blue" > Monitor treatment effectiveness and resistance </span>
* <span style="color:blue" > Prediction of response </span>

### How does it work?

#### Common Tools/Strategies of Precision Medicine
* Machine Learning
* Big Data
* Omics Biomolecule Studies

    - Genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics 
    
        <img align="bottom" src="pyramid.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

* <mark>**RNA-seq** </mark> -- *main focus in this presentation*

    > Provides insights into <span style="color:brown">gene expression</span>, <span style="color:brown" >alternative splicing</span> and <span style="color:brown" >transcriptomic changes</span> within cells or tissues. Which can be analyzed to <span style="color:blue" >predict treatment outcomes</span>, to <span style="color:blue" >monitor the progress and efficacy of treatment</span> and to <span style="color:blue" >understand the expression pattern</span>. These information can be interpreted to give the optimal treatment plan.

    - **Differential Expression Analysis**

        > Compare gene expression levels between different conditions or groups, such as <span style="color:red"> healthy vs. diseased samples</span>, <span style="color:red"> treated vs. untreated samples </span>, or <span style="color:red"> different developmental stages</span>. Differential expression analysis helps stratify patients into subgroups based on gene expression profiles, enabling the selection of the most appropriate and effective treatment strategies for each subgroup.

## Applications

### **RNAs** as <mark> biomarker

> RNA-seq allows detection of all different types of <span style="color:blue">coding RNAs (mRNA)</span> and <span style="color:blue">non-coding RNAs (snRNA, miRNA...)</span>. Differential expression of some specific genes of these types would positively or negatively correlate with disease pathology. Therefore, they serve as the biomarkers. This bioinformatics method would enhance our understanding of biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms associated with diseases.

#### Examples of tissue-based RNA biomarkers for cancer

| Biomarker Name  |	RNA Type	|Cancer Type	|Up/Down	|Value	|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|PAM50	|mRNA	|Breast cancer	|-	|Diagnosis/Prognosis|
|Cell Cycle Progression mRNA panel	|mRNA|	Prostate cancer|	Up|	Prognosis|
|PCA3	|lncRNA|	Prostate cancer|	Up|	Diagnosis|
|HULC	|lncRNA|	Pancreatic cancer|	Up|	Prognosis|
|HOTAIR	|lncRNA|	Nasopharyngeal cancer|	Up|	Prognosis|
|miR-21	|miRNA|	Pancreatic cancer|	Down|	Clinical outcome prediction, potential therapy   target|
|piR-651	|piwiRNA|	Lymphoma|	Down|	Prognosis|
|SNORD33, SNORD66, SNORD76	|snoRNA|	Non-small-cell lung cancer|	Up|	Diagnosis|
|Hsa_circ_002059	|circRNA|	Gastric cancer|	Down|	Diagnosis|

### **Cells** as <mark> biomarker

> Single Cell RNA-Seq can be applied to determine the <span style="color:blue"> size of the population of a specific cell type </span> that is related to metastasis. Principle component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of the data obtained from scRNA-Seq. Other clustering algorithms, like k-means clustering, are also used <span style="color:blue">isolate discrete transcriptome of the cancer related cells</span>. The characterization of individual cell types at high resolution provides valuable information for therapeutically targeting tumor metastasis and their interplay in transit and beyond.

* **Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC)**

    > CTCs hold unique biological characteristics that directly involve them in hematogenous dissemination

## Disadvantages

Cost and Technical Complexity:
* Costly Procedures: RNA-Seq involves high costs, including library preparation,    sequencing, computational resources, and expertise.
* Technical Expertise: Data analysis requires bioinformatics expertise, and the complexity of workflows demands skilled personnel.

Transcriptome Complexity:

* Alternative Splicing and Isoforms: RNA-Seq might struggle to accurately capture and quantify alternative splicing events and rare transcript isoforms due to their complexity.

Limited Sensitivity for Low-Abundance Transcripts:
* Detection Limits: RNA-Seq might miss detection of very low-abundance transcripts, leading to underrepresentation of rare transcripts.
